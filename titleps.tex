\section{Introduction}

The \textsf{titleps} package provides tools for one-stage setting of
page styles (headlines and footlines).  A higher-level interface is
used, where the mark mechanism is hidden and there is no need to deal
with |\leftmark|s and |\rightmark|s -- just use a command or variable
registered as a ``mark'' as the expected value will be returned, i.e.,
those when the mark was emitted, either by a sectioning command or
explicitly with |\chaptermark|, |\sectionmark|, etc.  A simple
example, whose meaning should be obvious, is:
\begin{verbatim}
\newpagestyle{main}{
  \sethead[\thepage][\chaptertitle][(\thesection]  % even
          {\thesection)}{\sectiontitle}{\thepage}} % odd
\pagestyle{main}
\end{verbatim}

Other features are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Working top marks, compatible with floats (unlike the standard 
|\topmark|, which does not work correctly in \LaTeX{}).
\item Access to top, first and botttom marks in a single headline/footline
(e.g., the first and last section numbers).
\item Marks for more than 2 sectioning levels.
\item Auto-defining of suitable |\sectionmark| and the like.
\item Simple (and not so simple) headrules and footrules.
\item Headlines and footlines for pages with floats.
\item Headlines and footlines for specific floats (a sort of 
|\thispagestyle| for floats).
\item Multiple sets of marks (named here \emph{markset}s and 
\textit{extra marks}).
\end{itemize}

It can be used without \textsf{titlesec}, but you will get most of 
it when used together.  To load it as a separate package, use the
customary \verb|\usepackage{titleps}|, but with \textsf{titlesec} you
have to load it with:
\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage[pagestyles]{titlesec}
\end{verbatim}

Specific tools for sectioning command marks are provided, which are
considered the main \textit{markset} (unnamed) and carry out some
internal task.  However, \textsf{titleps} can be used as well for
headers with the first an last entry of a page in a dictionary or index,
for example, thank to the \textit{extra marks} described below.

It works with standard classes and many others; however, additional
\LaTeX{} layout adjustments could be necessary in some of them (for
instance the \textsc{AMS} classes) and several packages emitting marks
directly with \verb|\markboth| and \verb|\markleft|.\footnote{%
Two columns layout requires the \textsf{fix2col} package by David
Carlisle.}

Once loaded the package, you can define your own page styles and then
activate them, but note page styles so defined cannot be used with
\verb|\thispagestyle| except if the surrounding page style has been
defined with \textsf{titleps}, too.

%%%% empty ? plain ?

\section{Defining Page Styles}

\begin{desc}
|\newpagestyle{<name>}[<global-style>]{<commands>}|\\
|\renewpagestyle{<name>}[<global-style>]{<commands>}|
\end{desc}

Defines a new style or redefines an existing one, named |<name>|.  For
convenience, spaces and end of lines are ignored, and you need not
``hide'' them with |%|.\footnote{Even if marks should be reserved
to pass information
to headers, some classes, like the AMS ones, introduce additional
code.  When redefining the |plain| style of AMS classes, you must add
the following line: |\cs{global}\cs{topskip}\cs{normaltopskip}|.}

|<global-style>| is any command to be applied to both footlines and 
headlines. Fragile commands are allowed.

In |<commands>| you can use:


\begin{desc}
|\sethead[<even-left>][<even-center>][<even-right>]|\\
|        {<odd-left>}{<odd-center>}{<odd-right>}|\\
|\setfoot[<even-left>][<even-center>][<even-right>]|\\
|        {<odd-left>}{<odd-center>}{<odd-right>}|
\end{desc}

Set the corresponding part in headlines and footlines (note the
``visual'' layout of parameters).  The optional arguments are the
three or none.  If no optional arguments are given the odd-page
settings applies to both even and odd pages.  A couple of starred
variant (|\setfoot*|, |\sethead*|) reverses the order of the settings
for even pages (obviously, with them the optional arguments are not
allowed).  If |\sethead| is not given, then the headline it is left
empty, and same for |\setfoot| and the footline.

In the arguments of |\sethead|/|\setfoot| and because of its one-stage
mechanism, we must distinguish between two groups of commands:
\begin{itemize}
\item The first one includes those saved when the marks are emitted,
with information related to sections, and includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item |\thechapter|, |\thesection|, |\thesubsection|\dots{}
\item |\chaptertitle|, |\sectiontitle|, |\subsectiontitle|\dots{} which print the 
chapter, section\dots{} title.
\item (Only \textsf{titlesec}.  Not in \textsf{titleps}.)
|\ifthechapter{<true>}{<false>}|, |\ifthesection{<true>}{<false>}|,
|\ifthesubsection{<true>}{<false>}|\dots{} which expands to |<true>|
except if the corresponding title lacks of label or there is no title
yet after the superior level (for example, between |\chapter| and a
subsequent |\section|).
\item Any other command or value ``registered'' as ``mark.'' (See below.)
\end{itemize}
They are ordinary commands, with no internal marks at all, and you can
test if, for example, they are empty.

\item The second group are those expanded on every page, and includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item |\thepage|.
\item Any other command not included in the previous items. 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{desc}
|\settitlemarks{<level-name>,<sublevel-name>,<subsublevel-name>...}|\\
|\settitlemarks*{<level-name>,<sublevel-name>,<subsublevel-name>...}|
\end{desc}
Sets which |\...title| commands are to be defined, and when the marks
are emitted; any number of levels is allowed (1, 2, 3...). For example 
|\settitlemarks{chapter,section}|
means that:
\begin{itemize}
\item |\chaptertitle| and |\sectiontitle| are the allowed titles in 
  headlines,
\item |\sectiontitle| is reset in |\chapter|,
\item (Only \textsf{titlesec}.  Not in \textsf{titleps}.)
|\ifthechapter| and |\ifthesection| are valid tests.
\item  Marks are updated in |\chapter| and  |\section|.
\end{itemize}
Default is |\settitlemarks{chapter,section}|, but
|\settitlemarks{section,subsection}| in \textsf{article} class.
|\settitlemarks| may be used outside |\(re)newpagestyle| to set the
default to be used in newly defined and redefined page styles -- it is 
used in |\pagestyle|.\footnote{The command \texttt{\string\setmarks} is
deprecated.  Now
\texttt{\string\setmarks\string{<primary>\string}\string{<secondary>\string}}is
\texttt{\string\settitlemarks\allowbreak\string{<primary>,\allowbreak<secundary>\string}}.}

The starred version |\settitlemarks*| creates parallel extra marks 
as described below.

\begin{desc}
|\headrule               \footrule|\\
|\setheadrule{<length>}  \setfootrule{<length>}|
\end{desc}

If you want a rule below the headline and above the footline.  You may 
also set their width directly with the commands |\setheadrule| and 
|\setfootrule|.  (For instance, |\setheadrule{.4pt}| which is, by the 
way, the default value.)

These commands are local to a page style, i.e., defining them directly
in the preamble will not work because the page style settings will
override them.

\begin{desc}
|\makeheadrule \makefootrule|
\end{desc}

These commands are used by \textsf{titleps} to typeset the rules.
If there is no rule, both commands are empty (this value is the 
default).
|\setheadrule{|\emph{dim}|}| just stands for
\begin{verbatim}
\renewcommand{\makeheadrule}{\rule[-.3\baselineskip]{\linewidth}{<dim>}}
\end{verbatim}
unless if \emph{dim} is 0 pt, which empties
|\makeheadrule| (and similarly |\setfootrule|).

You can access the total header/footer width with |\linewidth|
but the box enclosing the rule is in fact dimensionless. Hence,
you must be concerned with the rule placement only. Its
baseline is the same as that of the header/footer. That means the
material to be used as rule should be raised or lowered with
|\raisebox|, the lifting argument in |\rule| or by using sensible
coordinates in |picture|, for instance. That makes easy to
place material above \emph{and} below. For instance,
the following code creates a headline with a black bold line
above and a red rule below (the \textsf{color} package is required):
\begin{verbatim}
\renewcommand{\makeheadrule}{%
  \makebox[0pt][l]{\rule[.7\baselineskip]{\linewidth}{0.8pt}}%
  \color[named]{Red}%
  \rule[-.3\baselineskip]{\linewidth}{0.4pt}}
\end{verbatim}

Of course, the material to be used as rule is not restricted to actual
rules; pictures and leaders, for instance, are allowed, too.

\section{On \texttt{\cs{markboth}} and \texttt{\cs{markleft}}}

As \textit{The \LaTeX{} Companion explains} ``Leslie Lamport had a
specific marking scheme in mind when he designed those
commands''. They are clearly intended for the \verb|heading| and
\verb|myheading| pagestyles, with a \textit{main-mark} on the left
page and a \textit{sub-mark} on the right one.

In order to provide the functionality offered by \textsf{titleps}, a
more general, less specific mechanism is devised, which means
|\markboth| here does not make sense, because it doesn't work like in
standard \LaTeX, and in fact, can lead to unpredictable results.

Therefore, using directly the marking commands is discouraged (see
|titlesec.pdf|), but if you need them, you may write:
\begin{verbatim}
\chapter*{My Chapter}
\chaptermark{My Chapter}
\end{verbatim}

But some issues remain, because there are a number of packages
assuming the pagestyle is \verb|heading| or \verb|myheading|. This is,
of course, a reasonable guess, but not always correct (even if
\textsf{titleps} is not used at all). Most of them do the right thing
-- \verb|\markboth| is encapsulated into a macro easily redefinable so
that the user can modify it if necessary. This is true, for example,
for \textsf{biblatex}, but unfortunately not for \textsf{endnotes}.
When this happens, you can resort to the following macro.

\begin{desc}
|\setmarkboth{<code-to-use>}|
\end{desc}

From this point on, \verb|\markboth| behaves as defined. It doesn't
redefine directly the command, but rather provides a replacement code
(you can use |#1| and |#2| for the two arguments). With
|\resetmarkboth| (which can be used inside |\setmarkboth|) the
original definition will be again in force. For example, to cancel the
next |\markboth|:
\begin{verbatim}
\setmarkboth{\resetmarkboth\markboth{}{}}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Headline/footline width}

\begin{desc}
|\widenhead[<even-left>][<even-right>]{<odd-left>}{<odd-right>}|\\
|\widenhead*{<even-right/odd-left>}{<even-left/odd-right>}|
\end{desc}

Makes the headlines/footlines lines wider.  The extra width is
asymmetrically added and hence the two [four] arguments.  Like
|\sethead|, the starred version reverses the setting for even
pages---for example, |\widenhead*{0pt}{6pc}| is the same as
|\widenhead[6pc][0pt]{0pt}{6pc}|.

To be used outside |\(re)newpagestyle|.

\begin{desc}
|nopatches| \qquad (package option)
\end{desc}

By default, sectioning commands are patched slightly for top marks
and |\@mkboth| to work, so that page styles behave like standard
|headings|.  However, if you want to be explicit, like with standard
|myheadings|, and emit premarks and, if necessary, marks by yourself,
set this package option.  Remenber you have to use |\sectionmark| and
the like, and not |\markboth| or |\markright|.

You might also prefer to patch the sectioning commands by yourself,
either with low-level definitions or with the provided
|\TitlepsPatchSection| (with a starred version which adds no premark
and intended mainly for chapters).  For example:
\begin{verbatim}
\TitlepsPatchSection*{chapter}  % patches \chapter
\TitlepsPatchSection{section}   % patches \section
\end{verbatim}
(In standard classes |\part| emits no mark, and therefore it is not 
patched by default.)

\section{Marks}

Marks can be retrieved in 4 ways:
\begin{description}
\item[top marks] If a page begins with text, they are the marks 
belonging to the sectioning unit of that text. If a page begin with a 
sectioning title, they are the marks of that title. In other words, 
top marks refer to the section immediately adjacent to the 
headline.
\item[first marks] The marks of the very first sectioning title.
\item[botttom marks] The marks of the very last (bottom) sectioning 
title (also known as \textit{bot marks}).
\item[next top marks] A botttom mark with the values of the top mark of
the next page (only |straight| class or equivalent); by picking some
value from it and comparing it with the corresponding value from the
botttom marks you may know if a section continues in the next page.
Of course, it will not be used very often.
\end{description}
Standard \LaTeX{} provides only first and bottom marks. As you see, with 
\textsf{titleps} you have two additional marks, namely, top and next 
top marks.

It should be stressed top marks are not the same as the primitive
\verb|\topmark| (which, in fact, is not used internally at all).  They
are true top marks, returning the expected result when the title is at
the top of the page.  Further, they are compatible with floats, which
is not true with \verb|\topmark|s.  However, they fail with explicit
page breaks, but you can use \verb|\pretitlemark| as described
below.

\begin{desc}
|outermarks innermarks topmarks botmarks| \qquad (package options)
\end{desc}

|innermarks| is the default in \LaTeX, with bottom marks in even pages
and first marks in odd pages.  More convenient is |outermarks|, with
top marks in even pages and bottom marks in odd pages; it is the more
usual system in classic scientific literature and it is described in
\textit{The \TeX{}book}, p.~259.\footnote{|outermarks| may not work
well in conjunction with explicit |\string\<section>mark| commands} Both of them are intended for two side printing;
|topmarks|/|botmarks| are intended for one side printing with top/bot
marks in every page (they can be used in two side printing as well).

\begin{desc}
|\bottitlemarks  \toptitlemarks  \firsttitlemarks \nexttoptitlemarks|\\
|\outertitlemarks  \innertitlemarks|
\end{desc}

These commands set which mark the values of the subsequent
|\thesection|, |\sectiontitle|, etc., will be taken from. 
These macros are switches, and therefore subsequent commands and
variables are taken from the selected mark.  The following is valid:
\begin{verbatim}
\toptitlemarks\textbf{\thesection.} \sectiontitle --
\bottitlemarks\textbf{\thesection.} \sectiontitle
\end{verbatim}

You can use them freely in your headers;\,%
\footnote{Not exactly: top marks must not be used in the page where a
chapter begins, except by overriding the default definition and making
it of |top| class.} just for fun, the following header shows the
section label from three of these marks:
\begin{verbatim}
\newpagestyle{funny}{
  \sethead{\toptitlemarks Top is \thesection}
          {\firsttitlemarks First is \thesection}
          {\bottitlemarks Bot is \thesection}}
\end{verbatim}

In multilingual documents, the language in force is that corresponding
to the package options -- command versions does not switch the
language, but you can do it easily with the help a new title mark and
then switching the language, as explained below.

\begin{desc}
|\newtitlemark{<command-name>}|\\
|\newtitlemark*{<variable-name>}|
\end{desc}

Add a command or a variable to the list of ``marks'' to be emitted at
a sectioning command.  The macro must be parameterless, and the
variable is either a length, if it has the form \verb|\<name>|, or a
counter, if it has the form \verb|<name>| (i. e., a string).
For example, if you write (with \textsf{babel}):
\begin{verbatim}
\newtitlemark{\languagename}
\end{verbatim}
then a |\languagename| in the head/foot will contain the language when
the corresponding mark was emitted; unfortunately, \textsf{babel} 
does not allow |\languagename| as the first argument of
|\foreignlanguage| (it enters in a infinite loop), but there is a 
simple trick -- just use an intermediate command:
\begin{verbatim}
\newcommand\titlelanguage{\languagename}
\newtitlemark{\titlelanguage}
\end{verbatim}
(What is saved is the expansion of |\titlelanguage|, which is turn is 
the expansion of |\languagename|. Alternatively, you can create the 
intermediate command with |\let| in the header itself.)

Marks to be emitted at other places (not sectioning commands) are
handled with extra marks and \textit{marksets} (see below).

Commands must be robust, but not protected, or the value returned will
not be the right one.  Remember there are two kinds of robust commands
-- those containing in turn robust commands and those protected with,
say, |\DeclareRobustCommand|.\footnote{Unfortunately,
\texttt{\string\DeclareRobustCommand} has a misleading name, because a
command created with \texttt{\string\newcommand} can be robust, too.
A better name would have been
\texttt{\string\DeclareProtectedCommand}.} An example of how to use
protected commands is a layout used sometimes if sections are long as
well as their titles, where the title is splitted across the left and
the right pages.  Here is how this can be carried out:
\begin{verbatim}
\DeclareRobustCommand\splitheader[2]{#1 #2}
\def\contsplitheader{}

\def\dosplitheader{%
  \gdef\contsplitheader{}%
  \DeclareRobustCommand\splitheader[2]{##1\gdef\contsplitheader{##2}}}

\renewpagestyle{headings}{
  \sethead[\thepage]
          []
          [\dosplitheader\sectiontitle]
          {\contsplitheader}
          {}
          {\thepage}
}

\pagestyle{headings}
\end{verbatim}
(Note the header also uses |\DeclareRobustCommand|.)

\begin{desc}
|\pretitlemark{<section>}{<text>}|\\
|\pretitlemark*{<section>}{<text>}|
\end{desc}

Top marks require in fact two marks, one before the page break and
other after it.  This is done by \textsf{titlesec}, while 
\textsf{titleps} patches the sectioning commands as described above.

However, if you need an explicit page break you can emit the mark
with |\pretitlemark|.  For example:
\begin{verbatim}
\pretitlemark{section}{Performing Brahms}
\newpage
\section{Performing Brahms}
\end{verbatim}
Note the text in the premark is the title of the next section.  The
counter is advanced temporarily, so that it has the right value, but
if for some reason you do not want that, just use 
\verb|\pretitlemark*|.

\begin{desc}
|\ifsamemark{<group>}{<command>}{<true>}{<false>}|
\end{desc}

One of the disavantaged of the switching mechanism is that comparing 
a command from, say, the top marks and the botttom marks is not 
trivial. 
This macro just makes it simpler. If you want to compare the 
currect \verb|\thesection| with that in the top mark, write:
\begin{verbatim}
\ifsamemark\toptitlemarks\thesection{<true>}{<false>}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Running heads with floats}

\begin{desc}
|psfloats| \qquad (package option)
\end{desc}

This package option activates the commands described in this section.%
\footnote{It redefines some internal \LaTeX{} commands and there could be
incompatibilities with other packages modifying the same commands. That's
the very reason these commands are loaded only optionally. As of 
version 2.6 the syntax was extended with a new argument to allow
extra stuff in running heads/foots. This change is backward
compatible---just preserve the old name \verb|floatps|, which
is deprecated, if you want the pre-2.6 behaviour.}

\begin{desc}
|\setfloathead*{.}{.}{.}{<extra>}[<which-floats>]|\\
|\setfloathead[.][.][.]{.}{.}{.}{<extra>}[<which-floats>]|\\
(Similarly |\setfloatfoot|.)
\end{desc}

The arguments with a dot are similar to those of |\sethead|. The final
argument says the head is used when there is a float of
the specified types (default is |tp| in headers, and |bp| in footers).
For example:
\begin{verbatim}
\newpagestyle{main}{%
  \sethead ... your definition
  \setfoot ... your definition
  \headrule
  \footrule
  \setfloathead{}{}{}{\setheadrule{0pt}}[p]
  \setfloatfoot{}{}{}{\setfootrule{0pt}}[p]}
\end{verbatim}
removes the header/footer on float pages, including the rules.

\begin{desc}
|\nextfloathead*{.}{.}{.}{<extra>}[<which-floats>]|\\
|\nextfloathead[.][.][.]{.}{.}{.}{<extra>}[<which-floats>]|\\
(Similarly |\nextfloatfoot|.)
\end{desc}

You may force a header (respectively footer) when a certain float is
the first top one (respectively last bottom) with those commands just
before the corresponding float, where the arguments with a dot are
similar to those of |\sethead|.  Those commands are used by
themselves, without putting them inside |\(re)newpagestyle|.  So, to
empty the headline when a certain figure is placed at the top (because
it is a bleed, for example):
\begin{verbatim}
\nextfloathead{}{}{}{}[t]
\begin{figure}
...
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Extra marks}

Both \textsf{titlesec} and \textsf{titleps} provide tools for handling
extra marks, if you are using an $\epsilon$-\TeX{} based engine
(currently most of them) and load the \textsf{etex} package or
equivalent.  The way they work are conceptually similar to the title
marks described above -- you set which commands or variables are to
get synchronized in heads and foots.  To use extra marks, you have to
load them with the following package option:

\begin{desc}
|extramarks| \qquad (package option)
\end{desc}

Extra marks are subsidiary.  If page styles are modified internally by
another package and the document does not make use of sectioning
commands, you might still need an empty title mark (like
\verb|\sectionmark{}|), as well as to synchronize the language by
hand.

In many cases, the following ``short'' marks mechanism will be enough.
With it, you simply say with \verb|\newshormark| the name of a command
to be used in heads or foots, and then emit the mark at appropiated
places (short marks for variables are not available).  An example
illustrates how this is carried out:
\begin{verbatim}
\newcommand\lemmatitle{}

\newshortmark\lemmatitle

\newcommand\lemma[1]{%
  \renewcommand\lemmatitle{#1}%
  \preshortmark\lemmatitle % if you want top marks
  \pagebreak[2]%
  \vspace{1em}%
  \textbf{#1}\enspace
  \shortmark\lemmatitle}

\newpagestyle{main}{
  \sethead{}{\topshortmark\lemmatitle
            --\firstshortmark\lemmatitle
            --\botshortmark\lemmatitle
            --\nexttopshortmark\lemmatitle}{}}

\pagestyle{main}
\end{verbatim}

Top marks require emitting the marks before the page break -- just use
the command \verb|\preshortmark| as shown above.  Otherwise, you may
omit it.  Unlike title marks and extra marks, the selector of short
marks (\verb|\topshortmark|, \verb|\firstshortmark|,
\verb|\botshortmark|, \verb|\nexttopshortmark|), is \textit{not} a
switch and must be always immediately followed by the command to be
retrieved.

For a more general approach use the following tools.

\begin{desc}
|\newmarkset{<markset>}|
\end{desc}

A \textit{markset} contains a set of related commands and variables
intended to be emitted simultaneously as marks, so that their values
can be retrieved in heads/foots.  A typical \textit{markset} could be
a title and its counter (and perhaps, in a multilingual document, the
active language, i.e., \verb|\languagename| in \textsf{babel}, or an
intermediate command).  There is always a special unnamed
\textit{markset} for sectioning marks, which is the main one and
handled with the tools described above (with |title| in their names).

\begin{desc}
|\newextramark{<markset>}{<macro-name>}|\\
|\newextramark*{<markset>}{<variable-name>}|
\end{desc}

Add to a \textit{markset} a command or a variable to be synchronized .
They are identical to \verb|\newtitlemark| and \verb|\newtitlemark*|,
except for the additional parameter with the \textit{markset} name.

\begin{desc}
|\botextramarks{<markset>}      \topextramarks{<markset>}|\\
|\firstextramarks{<markset>}    \nexttopextramarks{<markset>}|\\
|\outerextramarks{<markset>}    \innerextramarks{<markset>}|
\end{desc}

The \verb|extra| counterparts of the \verb|title| commands described
above, with the same behaviour. For example:
\begin{verbatim}
\newcommand{\lemmatitle}{}
\newcounter{lemma}

\newmarkset{lemma}

\end{desc}

By default, \LaTeX{} and \textsf{titleps} use a single \textit{markset} for
all sectioning levels.  This is problematic, for example, in the
\textsf{article} class, because sections does not start a new page.
Consider the following piece of code:
\begin{verbatim}
\section{A section}
\subsection{A subsection}
\end{verbatim}
On odd pages with first marks and subsection titles, the head has 
no title, because \verb|\subsection| is the second mark, not the 
first one.

To overcome this limitation, you can use the starred version of
\verb|\settitlemarks|, which creates parallel \textit{marksets} (one per 
level) synchonized with the main \textit{markset}. They are retrieved like 
other extra marks, but they are special in that you cannot emit them 
by yourself -- they are always emitted by the corresponding 
sectioning mark. So, with
\begin{verbatim}
\settitlemarks*{section,subsection}
\end{verbatim}
and a page style containing
\begin{verbatim}
\firstextramarks{subsection}\subsectiontitle
\end{verbatim}
you retrieve the mark emitted by the first \verb|\subsection|, even 
if preceded by a \verb|\section|. (Top marks are best retrieved from
the main \textit{markset}.)

They are extra marks, and therefore language synchronization has to be
done by hand -- add \verb|\languagename| or an intermediate command to
the main \textit{markset} with \verb|\newtitlemark| and, if you want,
define a command. For example:
\begin{verbatim}
% use an intermediate command because we'll need \foreignlanguage
\newcommand\titlelanguage{\languagename}
\newtitlemark{\titlelanguage}

% define a command to ease defining page styles
\newcommand{\toplang}[1]{%
  {\topextramarks{section}%
   \foreignlanguage{\titlelanguage}{#1}}}
\end{verbatim}

\section{A couple of examples}

Because of the way marks are handled, special constructs like this are 
allowed: 
\begin{verbatim}
\newpagestyle{main}[\small\sffamily]{
   \sethead[\textbf{\thepage}] 
           [\textsl{\chaptertitle}]
           [[\toptitlemarks\thesection--\bottitlemarks\thesection]
           {\toptitlemarks\thesection--\bottitlemarks\thesection]} 
           {\textsl{\sectiontitle}}
           {\textbf{\thepage}}}
\end{verbatim}
As you can see, the range of sections in a page with |\thesection| is
printed in both left and right heads.  Of course, this example should
be fine tuned to collapse the ranges if there is a single section in a
page (with |\ifsamemark|), but it gives a hint of how to get stunning
headers.

In this document, the following styles are used:
\begin{verbatim}
\widenhead{2.1pc}{0pc}
\renewpagestyle{plain}[\small\sffamily\slshape]{
  \footrule 
  \setfoot{}{\thepage}{}}
\newpagestyle{myps}[\small\sffamily\slshape]{
  \headrule
  \sethead{titlesec -- titleps}{\sectiontitle}{\thepage}}
\end{verbatim}

The following definitions provide page styles similar to those in
Lamport's \textit{The \LaTeX\ book} (with the \textsf{calc} package):
\begin{verbatim}
\widenhead*{0pt}{\marginparsep + \marginparwidth}  % symmetrically
\renewpagestyle{plain}{}
\newpagestyle{latex}[\bfseries]{
  \headrule
  \sethead[\thepage][][\chaptertitle]
          {\thesection\ \sectiontitle}{}{\thepage}}
\pagestyle{latex}
\end{verbatim}

% \section{Remarks}
% 
% Page styles in standard \LaTeX{} are somewhat rudimentary. For 
% example |\thispagestyle| is not always correctly synchronized with 
% sectioning marks, and if you set |\pagestyle{plain}| and then 
% |\thispagestyle{headings}|, its behaviour is not the expected one. 
% The same happens if a page style defined in \textsf{titleps} is used 
% in a |\thispagestyle| in the context of a standard page style -- you 
% have to define the main one as well.
