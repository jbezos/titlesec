This directory holds 3 packages for sectioning titles -- when used as
such (titlesec), in headers and footers (titleps) and in tables of
contents (titletoc).  They can be used separately, but you will get
most of them when used together.

Titlesec
~~~~~~~~
Sectioning titles, including margin and `wrap' titles, different
format in odd and even pages, rules above and below the title, 
adding new sectioning levels, measuring the width of the title, etc.

Titletoc
~~~~~~~~
TOC entries, with the possibility of changing the format in the middle
of a document, grouping the entries in a single paragraph, pretty
free-forms entries, partial tocs, etc.  It's described in titlesec.pdf
(or .tex).

Titleps
~~~~~~~
Page styles with working top marks, access to top, first and bot marks
in a single header/footer, rules, headers/footers for specific floats
(kinda \thispagestyle), multiple sets of marks, etc.  An one-stage
mechanims is used, without intermediate \leftmark's or \rightmark's.

What's new (2.9. 2.10)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed \assignpagestyle, which did not work except in a 
few cases.
- Fixed an incompatibility with hyperref (wrong appendix 
name).
- Added \iftitlemeasuring
- Added package option uppercase
- Fixed a bug when reckoning the number of lines in wrap/drop.

2.9.1: Fixed a typo (a spurious > in wrap.tss).
2.9.2: Fixed another typo (\MessageBreag in ttlps.def)
2.10.0: New features in titleps also available in titlesec

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
No .ins/.dtx preinstalation is required.  Move the files to a place 
where LaTeX can find them and typeset titlesec.tex.  All of files in 
this directory are necessary for titlesec.sty to work, except the 
manual titlesec.tex (and this 'readme' file). The manual requires
titlesec.sty and titletoc.sty, and hence all the .tss and .def 
files as well.

Formerly there were files with extension .new (titlesec.new and
titletoc.new) used to patch the packages, but if present should be
removed (they will be ignored, however).

Known problems
~~~~~~~~~~
Some language styles (for babel) add the indentation
after a section in a so radical way that titlesec (which
uses the internal LaTeX macros) cannot supress it again.
For example, spanish (fixed in version 5.0) and frenchb.
